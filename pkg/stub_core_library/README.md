This package exists to create stubs for core libraries that can't be safely
imported on some platforms: `dart:io`, `dart:html`, and so on. These stubs are
included in the SDK and used by pub to support cross-platform packages.

This is an application package and is not intended to be uploaded to
pub.dartlang.org.
